# MLB Top 100 Players 
## Jonathan Olds - Fall 2020 ##

* This honors thesis project acts as an attempt to better understand the mindset of baseball analysts. Specifically, I was curious as to whether analysts exhibit preferences towards conventional baseball statistics or sabermetrics in their evaluation of players. This question was examined using logistic regression models in conjunction with two variable selection methods - principal components analysis and LASSO penalization. *

This repository contains the csv data files relevant to the project, the R and Rmd scripts used in the data organization, exploration and analysis process, and the pdf version of the final paper and slides used in my presentation of the thesis project on December 10, 2020.
